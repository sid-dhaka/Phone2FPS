# Phone2FPS
Turn your Android smartphone into a high-precision FPS game controller. This project transforms your phone into a combined keyboard and mouse. Designed specifically for First Person Shooters (FPS), it requires zero additional hardware. Just your phone and a WiFi connection.

**Functionality Provided** 
> Due to limited screen space and making a comfortabale and easily usable UI. Only limited functionality is possible.(Maybe some more keys can be added in future.)
1. Full 360 degree mouse mousement
2. Mouse1 or left click
3. Mouse2 or Right click
4. Keyboard W,A,S,D,R keys

How it Works Phone sends movement and touch data to PC. Which then translates it to mouse movement.

It was build with Counter Strike: Global Offensive(CS:GO) in mind. As of now it is tested with CS:GO, It works pretty well with it. It may or may not work with other First Person Shooters. Like in Valorant, everything works except mouse movement.
